# mootmaker API

A project that is part of my [Claude Code exploration](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/mootmaker).

A GraphQL API for scheduling meetings in meeting rooms. Clients can create rooms, people, and meetings, list each of them, and reset all stored data. The API is serverless: AWS AppSync fronts a set of Java Lambda functions backed by DynamoDB, and every component scales to zero so an idle deployment costs (almost) nothing.

## Data model

The GraphQL schema lives in [api/mootmaker.graphql](api/mootmaker.graphql). There are three entities:

- **Room** — `id`, `name`, `capacity`. Capacity is the total number of people the room holds (organiser + attendees).
- **Person** — `id`, `name`. Also has a backend-only `cognitoSub` attribute, not exposed over GraphQL: it's set to the Cognito user's `sub` for a Person created automatically on sign-up (see [Sign-up creates a linked Person](#sign-up-creates-a-linked-person)), and left unset for people added directly (e.g. guests with no login), so a future account-deletion flow can find and remove the Person linked to a deleted Cognito user.
- **Meeting** — `id`, `room`, `organiser` (a Person), `attendees` (list of Person), `subject`, `startTime`, `endTime`. `subject` must not be null or blank. Times are ISO-8601 local date-times with no time-zone offset (`java.time.LocalDateTime` semantics), e.g. `2026-07-01T14:30:00`, must fall on a 5-minute boundary, and `startTime`/`endTime` must fall on the same calendar date — a meeting cannot span midnight (see [Validation](#validation)).

All `id` values are server-generated UUIDs; clients never supply ids on creation.

### Storage

Rooms, people, and meetings each have their own DynamoDB table (`mootmaker-rooms`, `mootmaker-people`, `mootmaker-meetings`), keyed by `id`. Meetings are stored **normalised**: a meeting item holds only `roomId`, `organiserId`, and `attendeeIds`, not the room/person objects themselves, so later changes to a room or person are reflected immediately in every meeting that references it. [ListMeetingsHandler](impl/src/main/java/com/mootmaker/handler/ListMeetingsHandler.java) resolves those ids back into full `Room`/`Person` objects for the GraphQL response using [BatchLoader](impl/src/main/java/com/mootmaker/dynamo/BatchLoader.java), which deduplicates ids across all meetings first (so a room or person referenced by many meetings is fetched once, via `BatchGetItem`) and fetches the rooms table and people table concurrently.

`startTime`/`endTime` are stored in a canonical, always-19-character format (`MeetingRecord.DATE_TIME_FORMAT`, e.g. `2026-07-01T09:00:00`) rather than the client's raw input text, so they sort correctly as plain strings — this is what makes the range queries below exact string comparisons rather than needing to parse every candidate item. It's also why a meeting can't span midnight (see [Validation](#validation)): every meeting is guaranteed to fall within a single calendar day, so "does this meeting's date match" and "could this meeting possibly overlap that window" are always answerable from `startTime` alone, with no cross-midnight case to account for.

#### Querying meetings by date range and/or person, without scanning

`Query.meetings(filter: MeetingsFilter)` accepts an optional `fromStartTime`/`toEndTime` window and/or `personId` (matching organiser or attendee). `ListMeetingsHandler` picks one of four DynamoDB access patterns depending on which filter fields are present, so it never reads more than the matching meetings:

| Filter | Access pattern |
|---|---|
| none | `Scan` the meetings table — the caller genuinely wants everything, so this isn't a workaround |
| date range only | `Query` the meetings table's `bucket-startTime-index` GSI (hash key is a constant `"ALL"`, range key `startTime` — there's no other partitioning dimension for "every meeting's startTime") |
| `personId` only | `Query` the `mootmaker-meeting-participants` table (see below), hash key `personId`, no range condition |
| both | `Query` the same table with a range condition on its sort key |

**Why `bucket-startTime-index`'s hash key is a constant.** The date-range-only query means "every meeting in this window," not "every meeting for this room" or "for this person" — there's no field to naturally shard by. DynamoDB requires every GSI to have a hash key, and a `Query` can only ever target one hash key value per call, so the only way to answer an arbitrary date range with a *single* `Query` (rather than, say, one call per room) is to give every item the same hash key value. That collapses the GSI to one logical partition, sorted entirely by the sort key `startTime` — functionally a sorted index over the whole table. The trade-off is that a single partition is capped by DynamoDB's per-partition limits (~3,000 RCU / 1,000 WCU / 10 GB) — fine at this project's scale, but bucketing by something coarser (e.g. year-month) would be the next step at real scale, at the cost of a query spanning a bucket boundary needing two `Query` calls merged in Java instead of one. Contrast with `roomId-startTime-index` below, whose hash key is `roomId`: the overlap check genuinely does have a partitioning dimension (it always asks "meetings for *this* room"), so it isn't subject to this limit at all.

Both of the range-bounded queries (date-only, against `bucket-startTime-index`; `personId`+range, against meeting-participants) bound the key condition at the start of `fromStartTime`'s calendar day rather than `fromStartTime` itself — a safe bound (not a heuristic) because a meeting confined to one day can't still be running from a previous day. DynamoDB only allows a single condition on a sort key, so both ends of that bound go through one `BETWEEN` in the key condition rather than two separate comparators — and `BETWEEN` is inclusive on both ends, which the two queries handle differently:

- **`bucket-startTime-index`**'s sort key *is* `startTime`, and DynamoDB rejects a `FilterExpression` that references an index's own key attributes — so the exclusive upper bound can't be expressed as `startTime < toEndTime` in a filter (that's not a hypothetical: it's exactly what an earlier version of this code tried, and DynamoDB rejected it with "Filter Expression can only contain non-primary key attributes"). `endTime` isn't part of this index's key schema, so it's fine in a `FilterExpression` (`endTime > fromStartTime`, for the low-end overlap check), but the upper bound has to be enforced in Java after the query returns, by dropping any item whose `startTime` exactly equals `toEndTime`.
- **meeting-participants**' sort key is the compound string `startTime + "#" + meetingId` (see below), so a bare `toEndTime` string as the `BETWEEN` upper bound is naturally exclusive there already — every real row's key is strictly longer, and therefore greater, than the bare boundary string — so no extra Java-side step is needed for that one.

(Separately: `bucket` is also a DynamoDB reserved word, so `#bucket = :bucket` needs an `ExpressionAttributeNames` alias — a literal `bucket = :bucket` is rejected the same way as the `startTime` filter above.)

This still costs read capacity for the (small, date-bounded) candidates either check discards, but neither ever scans the whole table.

`CreateMeetingHandler`'s overlap check (`roomHasOverlappingMeeting`) uses `roomId-startTime-index` with `begins_with(startTime, datePrefix)` instead: since two meetings for the same room can only possibly overlap if they share a date, this returns exactly that room's meetings for that one day, which are then checked for a real time overlap in Java.

#### The meeting-participants table

`attendeeIds` is a list on the meeting item, and DynamoDB keys must be scalars, so "which meetings is this person organiser of or an attendee on" can't be answered with a GSI on the meetings table itself. `mootmaker-meeting-participants` (hash key `personId`, range key `sortKey` = `startTime` + `"#"` + `meetingId`) exists purely to answer that: one row per (meeting, participant) pair — the organiser plus every attendee — written by [MeetingParticipant](impl/src/main/java/com/mootmaker/model/MeetingParticipant.java). `CreateMeetingHandler` writes a meeting and all of its participant rows in a single `TransactWriteItems` call, so the two can never drift under normal operation.

The meetings table remains the source of truth; meeting-participants is a **derived index**. [mootmaker-tools/database-repair](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/mootmaker-tools/tree/main/database-repair)'s `RebuildMeetingParticipantsRepair` regenerates it from the meetings table — needed once when this table is introduced against an environment that already has meetings (existing meetings have no participant rows until then), and as a safety net against drift.

### API operations

| Operation | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `rooms`, `people` | Query | List all items of each type |
| `meetings(filter: MeetingsFilter)` | Query | Lists meetings, optionally narrowed by a `fromStartTime`/`toEndTime` window and/or `personId` (organiser or attendee) — see [Querying meetings by date range and/or person](#querying-meetings-by-date-range-andor-person-without-scanning) |
| `myPerson` | Query | Returns the `Person` linked to the caller's own Cognito account (via `identity.sub`), or `null` if none exists |
| `createRoom(room)` | Mutation | Returns `CreateRoomResult` (room or validation errors) |
| `createPerson(person)` | Mutation | Returns the created `Person`; no validation |
| `createMeeting(meeting)` | Mutation | Returns `CreateMeetingResult` (meeting or validation errors) |
| `reset` | Mutation | Deletes all rooms and meetings, and every person except those linked to a Cognito account (see [Reset and real user accounts](#reset-and-real-user-accounts)) |

Sample requests for every operation are in [api/requests.http](api/requests.http). To use them: deploy, run `source authenticate.sh <environment>`, open the file in VS Code (REST Client extension), and run the **"Get an access token"** request first — the other requests reference the returned token via `{{cognitoToken.response.body.$.access_token}}` and send it in the `Authorization` header. Tokens last 1 hour; re-run the token request when one expires.

## How it is implemented

```
Client ──HTTP/GraphQL──▶ AWS AppSync ──direct Lambda resolver──▶ Java Lambda ──▶ DynamoDB
```

- **AWS AppSync** hosts the GraphQL endpoint and validates requests against the schema. Authentication is a **Cognito user pool** — every request must carry a valid JWT (see [Authentication](#authentication)). Every query and mutation field has its own resolver.
- Each resolver is a **direct Lambda resolver**: the request template forwards the whole AppSync context (`$ctx`) as the Lambda payload, and the response template returns the Lambda result as-is. There is no VTL mapping logic — all behaviour lives in Java.
- **One Lambda function per GraphQL field** (8 in total: list-rooms, list-people, list-meetings, create-room, create-person, my-person, create-meeting, reset), plus one more that isn't a GraphQL resolver at all: `post-confirmation-create-person`, a Cognito trigger (see below). All are built from a single shaded jar (`impl/target/mootmaker-api.jar`), differing only in the handler class, e.g. `com.mootmaker.handler.CreateMeetingHandler`. Runtime is Java 25, 512 MB, 15 s timeout.
- Handlers read the table names from environment variables (`ROOMS_TABLE_NAME`, `PEOPLE_TABLE_NAME`, `MEETINGS_TABLE_NAME`, `MEETING_PARTICIPANTS_TABLE_NAME`) set by Terraform, and use the AWS SDK v2 DynamoDB client.
- **DynamoDB** stores the data in four on-demand (`PAY_PER_REQUEST`) tables (see [Storage](#storage)).
- All resources are named with the `mootmaker` prefix and created in `us-east-1` by default (see [deploy/terraform/variables.tf](deploy/terraform/variables.tf)).

## Sign-up creates a linked Person

When a user confirms their email during sign-up (in the [mootmaker-webapp](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/mootmaker-webapp)), a Cognito **PostConfirmation Lambda trigger** ([PostConfirmationCreatePersonHandler](impl/src/main/java/com/mootmaker/handler/PostConfirmationCreatePersonHandler.java), wired up in [cognito.tf](deploy/terraform/cognito.tf)) automatically creates a `Person` using the `name` the user entered on sign-up, and links it to the account via `cognitoSub`.

This runs **after** email confirmation rather than before (a `PreSignUp` trigger would fire while the address is still unverified, risking orphaned Person records for abandoned or typo'd sign-ups) or from the browser (a client-side call after `confirmSignUp()` would leave a confirmed account with no Person if the tab closes or the network drops before that call completes). Cognito also retries `PostConfirmation` invocations on failure, so the handler is idempotent — it checks the `cognitoSub-index` GSI on the People table before writing, and skips creation if a Person already exists for that `sub`. Because Cognito treats an exception thrown here as a failure of the user's confirm-sign-up call (even though the account is already confirmed by that point), the handler logs and swallows any error rather than throwing, so a transient DynamoDB problem never blocks sign-up.

Note: the Terraform-managed e2e test user and demo user ([cognito.tf](deploy/terraform/cognito.tf) `aws_cognito_user.e2e` and `aws_cognito_user.demo`) are created directly rather than through the sign-up/confirm API calls, so neither gets a linked Person this way. The demo user's Person is instead written directly by an `aws_dynamodb_table_item` resource in [cognito.tf](deploy/terraform/cognito.tf), in the same shape `PostConfirmationCreatePersonHandler` would produce and linked via `cognitoSub` to the demo user's `sub`. The e2e test user has no such workaround and so has no Person at all — nothing in the webapp or acceptance tests reads its name.

### Reset and real user accounts

`Mutation.reset` ([ResetHandler](impl/src/main/java/com/mootmaker/handler/ResetHandler.java)) always deletes every room and meeting, but only deletes a person if its `cognitoSub` is unset. A real signed-up user's Person record is their only link back to their Cognito account (nothing recreates it after the fact — see above), so unconditionally wiping it on every reset would silently break their account the next time someone reset a shared, non-production environment. Guests added directly (no `cognitoSub`) have no such link and are always cleared, keeping `reset` useful for acceptance tests and tools like [mootmaker-tools](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/mootmaker-tools)' sample data generator without ever touching a real account — including the e2e test user (which has no Person at all, per the note above) and the demo user (which has a Person, but with `cognitoSub` set like any real account, so it's preserved by the same rule).

### Displaying the signed-in user's name

The webapp shows the signed-in user's name (see [MyPersonHandler](impl/src/main/java/com/mootmaker/handler/MyPersonHandler.java)/`Query.myPerson`) by reading it live from the `Person` record rather than from the Cognito JWT, so a future "change my name" feature only has to write one place. The `cognitoSub-index` GSI has `ALL` projection (not `KEYS_ONLY`) specifically so this resolver can read the full item straight off the index in one request.

This was chosen over customising the `name` claim in the ID token with a Pre Token Generation Lambda trigger. That approach would also work, but a token's claims are only refreshed on next sign-in/token-refresh (up to the token's ~1 hour lifetime), so a rename would appear stale for up to an hour; reading `myPerson` on demand is always current. It also avoids a subtler correctness gap: `ConfirmSignUp` invokes the `PostConfirmation` trigger synchronously and Cognito won't authenticate an unconfirmed user, so the trigger that creates the Person is guaranteed to have *run* before any sign-in — but not guaranteed to have *succeeded* (its DynamoDB write is deliberately swallowed on error, see above) or to be *visible yet* (DynamoDB GSI reads are only eventually consistent, and the webapp signs the user in immediately after confirming). A Pre Token Generation trigger racing that same window could bake a missing/stale name into a token for up to an hour; `myPerson` just returns `null` for that one moment and the webapp's existing email/JWT-name fallback covers it until the next query.

## Authentication

All access to the API is authenticated by an **Amazon Cognito user pool** (`mootmaker-users`, created by Terraform in [deploy/terraform/cognito.tf](deploy/terraform/cognito.tf)). Users sign in with an **email address and password**; Cognito emails a verification code on sign-up, and account recovery (forgot password) works the same way — a code emailed to the verified address. There is no API key.

Every GraphQL request must carry a JWT issued by the user pool in the `Authorization` header (the raw token, no `Bearer` prefix). Enforcement happens in two layers:

1. **AppSync** is configured with `AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS` authentication: it verifies the token's signature, issuer, and expiry against the user pool **before any resolver runs**, and returns HTTP 401 `UnauthorizedException` otherwise.
2. **Every Lambda handler** re-checks, before running any logic, that the AppSync context it received contains an authenticated `identity` ([Identity.requireAuthenticated](impl/src/main/java/com/mootmaker/handler/Identity.java)) — defence-in-depth in case the API is ever accidentally exposed without the authoriser.

The user pool has two app clients (plus a hosted domain used only for the OAuth2 token endpoint):

| App client | Kind | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `mootmaker-webapp` | Public (no secret), SRP auth flow | The [mootmaker-webapp](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/mootmaker-webapp) browser SPA: users sign up / sign in and their id token is sent with each GraphQL call |
| `mootmaker-acceptance-tests` | Confidential (client secret), OAuth2 `client_credentials` flow | The [verify/](verify/) acceptance tests and [api/requests.http](api/requests.http) |

### Demo user

This is a demo system rather than a real business, so every deployment — including a "production" one — includes a pre-confirmed, publicly-known demo user (`demo@mootmaker.com`, Terraform outputs `demo_user_email` / `demo_user_password`, resources `aws_cognito_user.demo` / `random_password.demo_user` in [cognito.tf](deploy/terraform/cognito.tf)) that anyone can sign in as without creating their own account. Its password is randomly generated at deploy time (like the e2e test user's), but restricted to lowercase letters and digits only, so it's easy to read and type by hand when the webapp shows it on the home page. It is not a secret and its output is not marked `sensitive` — the whole point is that it's shown in the clear. (An earlier version used a fixed password, `demo1234`, which turned out to be on Google's list of known-compromised passwords; it's random now to avoid that.)

The user pool's password policy is set correspondingly loose to match: a minimum of 10 characters with a lowercase letter and a number, and no requirement for uppercase letters or symbols. A real product would want a stricter policy; this one is deliberately weakened so the demo password (and anyone else's) is easy to type.

### Authentication in end-to-end tests

Both projects' end-to-end tests run non-interactively (a dev shell or CI), so neither can prompt a human for credentials. They authenticate differently because they test different things:

- **The API acceptance tests in [verify/](verify/) use machine-to-machine (M2M) auth** — the OAuth2 **client_credentials flow**. [GraphQlClient](verify/src/test/java/com/mootmaker/verify/GraphQlClient.java) POSTs the test client's id and secret (read from the `COGNITO_TEST_CLIENT_ID` / `COGNITO_TEST_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables, which `authenticate.sh` populates from Terraform outputs) to the user pool's token endpoint (`COGNITO_TOKEN_URL`) and receives a short-lived (1 h) JWT access token scoped to `mootmaker-api/execute`, which AppSync accepts like any user token. One token is fetched per test run and shared by all test classes.
- **The webapp's Playwright tests sign in as a real user** — a Terraform-managed, pre-confirmed user `e2e-tests@example.com` (outputs `e2e_user_email` / `e2e_user_password`). A browser sign-in form inherently needs a user, and exercising the real sign-in UI is part of what those tests verify.

[AuthenticationAcceptanceIT](verify/src/test/java/com/mootmaker/verify/AuthenticationAcceptanceIT.java) proves the API is closed: requests with no token, a malformed token, or a forged JWT all get HTTP 401 and no data, while a client_credentials token succeeds.

## Directory structure

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| [api/](api/) | GraphQL schema ([mootmaker.graphql](api/mootmaker.graphql)) and sample requests ([requests.http](api/requests.http)) |
| [impl/](impl/) | Maven project with the Java Lambda handlers (`com.mootmaker.handler.*`), model records (`com.mootmaker.model.*`), and unit tests. Builds the shaded jar deployed to Lambda. |
| [deploy/terraform/](deploy/terraform/) | Terraform for all AWS resources: AppSync API, resolvers and data sources ([appsync.tf](deploy/terraform/appsync.tf)), Cognito user pool, app clients, the e2e test user, and the public demo user ([cognito.tf](deploy/terraform/cognito.tf)), Lambda functions ([lambda.tf](deploy/terraform/lambda.tf)), DynamoDB tables ([dynamodb.tf](deploy/terraform/dynamodb.tf)), IAM roles ([iam.tf](deploy/terraform/iam.tf)), outputs (API URL, Cognito ids, test and demo user credentials). All resource names are prefixed with `<environment>-<project_name>` ([locals.tf](deploy/terraform/locals.tf)) so multiple environments can coexist in one AWS account. State is stored remotely in S3, one state file per environment ([backend.hcl](deploy/terraform/backend.hcl) — see the [mootmaker-bootstrap-terraform](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/mootmaker-bootstrap-terraform) README for how that bucket is set up, and the [mootmaker project README](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/mootmaker#multi-environment-deployments) for the multi-environment design). |
| [verify/](verify/) | Maven project with JUnit acceptance tests (`*IT.java`, run by failsafe) that exercise the **deployed** API over HTTP. |

### Bash scripts

All scripts live in the project root and are run from there:

| Script | What it does | How to run |
|---|---|---|
| [deploy.sh](deploy.sh) | Builds the Lambda jar (`mvn clean package` in `impl/`), then `terraform init` + `terraform apply -auto-approve` to create/update all AWS resources **for the given environment**. Creates real AWS resources — run deliberately. | `./deploy.sh <environment>` |
| [undeploy.sh](undeploy.sh) | `terraform destroy` — deletes the AppSync API, Lambdas, and DynamoDB tables **including all stored data**, for the given environment. Prompts for confirmation. | `./undeploy.sh <environment>` |
| [authenticate.sh](authenticate.sh) | Reads the given environment's Terraform outputs and exports `GRAPHQL_API_URL`, the `COGNITO_*` variables (user pool id, webapp client id, token URL, test client id/secret/scope) and the `E2E_USER_*` test-user credentials into the current shell. Must be **sourced**, not executed. | `source authenticate.sh <environment>` |
| [verify.sh](verify.sh) | Sources `authenticate.sh <environment>`, then runs the acceptance tests (`mvn clean verify` in `verify/`) against that environment's deployed API. | `./verify.sh <environment>` |

## Build, test, deploy

Prerequisites: Java 25, Maven, Terraform ≥ 1.10, and AWS credentials configured for the target account.

Every deploy/undeploy/authenticate/verify script takes an **environment** name
(e.g. `test`, `production`, or your own name for a personal sandbox) so
multiple independent copies of the API can run in the same AWS account at
once — see the [mootmaker project README](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/mootmaker#multi-environment-deployments)
for the full multi-environment how-to and the reasoning behind it.

### Custom domain

Each environment deploys behind its own hostname under `mootmaker.com`:
`production` gets `api.mootmaker.com`, every other environment gets
`api.<environment>.mootmaker.com` (see [domain.tf](deploy/terraform/domain.tf)
for why each environment provisions its own certificate rather than sharing
one wildcard). `deploy.sh`/`undeploy.sh` refuse any environment name that
starts with `prod` but isn't exactly `production`, to avoid a typo silently
landing on a production-looking-but-not-actually-production subdomain.
Requires [mootmaker-domain](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/mootmaker-domain)
to already be deployed, with its nameservers configured at the registrar and
delegation propagated - see that project's README.

```bash
# Build the Lambda jar and run unit tests
mvn -f impl/pom.xml clean package

# Deploy (build + terraform apply) to an environment, e.g. "test" or your own name
./deploy.sh test

# Run acceptance tests against that environment's deployed API
./verify.sh test

# Tear it down when you're done
./undeploy.sh test
```

The acceptance tests need a deployed API; they read the endpoint and the Cognito client_credentials settings from the environment variables exported by `authenticate.sh`, and fetch a JWT from the token endpoint before calling the API (see [Authentication](#authentication)). Note that `reset` and the acceptance tests delete/modify live data, so don't point them at a deployment you care about.

## Cost model

Every component is configured to scale to zero, so a deployed-but-idle API costs effectively nothing. All costs are **per-use**:

| Resource | Billing | Idle cost |
|---|---|---|
| AppSync | Per query/mutation request | $0 |
| Lambda | Per invocation + GB-seconds of execution | $0 |
| DynamoDB | On-demand (`PAY_PER_REQUEST`): per read/write request unit + storage | ~$0 (storage only, negligible at this scale) |
| Cognito | Per monthly active user (10k free), plus $0.00225 per M2M token issued to the acceptance-test client (no free tier) | $0 |
| CloudWatch Logs | Per GB ingested/stored from Lambda logs | ~$0 when idle |
| ACM certificate (custom domain) | Free when attached to AppSync | $0 |
| Route53 record (custom domain) | Covered by [mootmaker-domain](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/mootmaker-domain)'s hosted zone; query volume is negligible at this scale | $0 |

There are no fixed-price resources (no provisioned DynamoDB capacity, no EC2/containers, no NAT gateways, no provisioned Lambda concurrency). Costs scale linearly with API call volume: each GraphQL call is one AppSync request, one Lambda invocation, and one or more DynamoDB operations.

One scaling caveat: `reset` and an unfiltered `meetings` query still **scan** whole tables rather than using an index, so their DynamoDB read cost grows with total stored data, not just with call volume. That's an intentional trade-off for `reset` (it needs to enumerate literally everything to delete it) and for an unfiltered `meetings` call (it's asking for literally everything), but not for `createMeeting`'s overlap check or a filtered `meetings` query — both of those go through the `bucket-startTime-index`/`roomId-startTime-index` GSIs or the meeting-participants table instead (see [Storage](#storage)), so their cost is bounded by the size of the matching result, not total stored data.

`createMeeting` writes cost slightly more than one write request unit now: it writes the meeting plus one meeting-participants row per organiser/attendee in a single `TransactWriteItems` call, which DynamoDB bills at 2× the normal per-item write cost. For a typical small meeting (a couple of attendees) that's still a handful of write request units — a fraction of a cent even at thousands of meetings/month, negligible next to Lambda/AppSync costs.

## Validation

### How it works

Validation is implemented entirely in the Java Lambda handlers (not in AppSync/VTL, apart from the type/nullability checks the GraphQL schema itself enforces). The create mutations for rooms and meetings never throw GraphQL errors for rule violations; instead they return a **structured result object**:

- `CreateRoomResult { room, errors: [RoomError!]! }`
- `CreateMeetingResult { meeting, errors: [MeetingError!]! }`

On success the entity field is populated and `errors` is empty. On failure the entity field is `null` and `errors` contains **one enum entry per rule broken** — the handlers collect all violations rather than stopping at the first, so a client gets the complete list in one round trip. Nothing is written to DynamoDB unless validation passes.

### Rules

`createRoom` ([CreateRoomHandler](impl/src/main/java/com/mootmaker/handler/CreateRoomHandler.java)):

| Error | Rule |
|---|---|
| `NameRequired` | `name` must not be null or blank |
| `CapacityTooLow` | `capacity` must be ≥ 2 |

`createMeeting` ([CreateMeetingHandler](impl/src/main/java/com/mootmaker/handler/CreateMeetingHandler.java)):

| Error | Rule |
|---|---|
| `StartMissaligned` / `EndMissaligned` | Start/end time must parse as an ISO-8601 local date-time and fall exactly on a 5-minute boundary (no seconds/nanos) |
| `SpansMultipleDays` | `startTime` and `endTime` must fall on the same calendar date — a meeting cannot span midnight |
| `RoomRequired` | `roomId` must not be blank |
| `RoomNotFound` | `roomId` must refer to an existing room |
| `OrganiserRequired` | `organiserId` must not be blank |
| `OrganiserNotFound` | `organiserId` must refer to an existing person |
| `AttendeeNotFound` | Every id in `attendeeIds` must refer to an existing person (one error per missing attendee) |
| `SubjectRequired` | `subject` must not be null or blank |
| `InsufficientCapacity` | Room capacity must be ≥ 1 + number of attendees (the organiser counts) |
| `TimeRangeUnavailable` | The room must have no existing meeting overlapping the requested `[startTime, endTime)` range (touching end-to-start is allowed) |

`createPerson` performs no validation beyond the schema's non-null `name`. The acceptance tests in [verify/](verify/) cover these rules end-to-end against the deployed API.

## Implementation choices

#### Why M2M was chosen for the API tests

The alternatives considered, and why they lost:

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| **Test user + `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`** (tests sign in with an email/password from Terraform outputs) | Works, and is marginally cheaper (user sign-ins are covered by the free MAU tier, while M2M tokens cost $0.00225 each with no free tier — pennies per year at this project's scale). But it puts a username/password in the test pipeline and makes the tests impersonate a fake "person", when what is really calling the API is a program. |
| **IAM (SigV4) as a second AppSync auth mode** | Free, but it weakens the security model: the API would no longer have the single invariant "every request carries a user-pool JWT", and the tests would then be exercising a different auth path than real clients use. It also needs AWS-credential signing in the test client. |
| **Keeping an API key for tests only** | Same problem — a second, weaker auth mode that bypasses Cognito entirely, and exactly what this design set out to remove. |

client_credentials won because it is the standard OAuth2 pattern for service-to-service callers: **no username or password exists anywhere in the flow**, the secret is generated by Terraform (never appearing in the repo) and is rotatable/revocable independently of any user, the token's identity honestly says "the acceptance-test client" rather than pretending to be a person, and — crucially — the resulting JWT goes through the **same AppSync user-pool authoriser and the same handler identity check as real user traffic**, so the tests exercise the production auth path. The only extra infrastructure it needs is the hosted domain (for the token endpoint) and the resource-server scope, both free.
